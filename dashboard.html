      <h2>Spatial Correlation of Floods, AWD, and Malaria in Ethiopia, 2010</h2>
      <p>In 2010, Ethiopia experienced significant humanitarian challenges as above-average rainfall during the kiremt (June–September) rainy season caused widespread flooding across several regions, including Afar, Amhara, Oromia, Somali, and Gambella. OCHA reports from that year highlight that these floods displaced thousands of households, damaged homes, destroyed crops, and disrupted water and sanitation infrastructure, creating conditions favorable for both waterborne and vector-borne diseases. The intersection of environmental hazards and public health threats was particularly evident when mapping acute watery diarrhoea (AWD) and malaria incidence against flood-prone areas. Flooded areas and stagnant water created ideal breeding conditions for Anopheles mosquitoes, which transmit malaria, while contamination of drinking water sources increased the risk of AWD outbreaks, including cholera and other diarrhoeal diseases. Children under five, pregnant women, and displaced populations in flood-affected woredas were most vulnerable, as limited access to clean water, overcrowding in temporary shelters, and disruption of health services exacerbated morbidity and mortality. Spatial analysis indicates that lowland and riverine zones, particularly along the Awash and Omo river basins, experienced the highest convergence of these risks, whereas highland regions were comparatively less affected due to cooler temperatures limiting mosquito populations and lower flood exposure. Humanitarian responses coordinated by OCHA and partners, including UNICEF, WHO, CARE, and regional health bureaus, prioritized immediate interventions such as distribution of water purification chemicals, sanitation kits, insecticide-treated nets, and deployment of mobile health teams to flood-affected communities. Health education campaigns emphasized safe water use, hygiene practices, and early treatment-seeking behavior for diarrhoeal illness, while integrated disease surveillance helped identify emerging hotspots. The 2010 experience underscores the strong correlation between flood exposure, AWD, and malaria risk, highlighting the critical importance of integrated disaster response, preventive health measures, and spatial risk mapping to mitigate the impacts of climate-sensitive health emergencies in Ethiopia. Overall, the map illustrating this correlation serves as a vital tool for targeting interventions and strengthening resilience in flood-prone, high-risk districts.</p>

      <h2>Essential Vaccine Administration in Ethiopia (December 2019 – November 2020)</h2>
      <p>In late 2019 and throughout 2020, Ethiopia’s routine immunization system faced significant challenges due to the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Even before the pandemic, immunization coverage in Ethiopia was below global targets, with estimates showing that only about 43 % of children aged 12–23 months had received a full schedule of basic vaccinations in 2019, and coverage varied widely by region, with much lower rates in rural and pastoral areas. Genetic and demographic surveys suggest long-standing urban-rural disparities in vaccine uptake.

When COVID-19 began spreading in Ethiopia in early 2020, routine childhood vaccination services were disrupted by movement restrictions, fear of infection at health facilities, and the redeployment of health workers to pandemic response duties. Global modeling by WHO and UNICEF found that disruptions to immunization services were reported in many countries in 2020, putting gains in childhood vaccinations at risk, and Ethiopia was listed among the African countries with high numbers of children missing critical vaccine doses such as DTP-1 and measles.

Local evidence from Ethiopian regions such as Oromia confirmed that COVID-19 disrupted the availability of routine vaccine supplies (including BCG, oral and injectable polio vaccines, and pentavalent vaccines), with transport and workforce challenges limiting service delivery. Meanwhile, health authorities faced difficult decisions about postponing some preventive campaigns, such as integrated measles and polio immunizations originally scheduled for April 2020; delay was partly due to concerns about transmission risks at crowded vaccination sites.

Despite these disruptions, the Government of Ethiopia, supported by partners such as WHO and UNICEF, prioritized maintaining essential immunization services. Child vaccination campaigns were adapted to reduce crowding and improve safety — for example, extending campaign duration and providing services outdoors — and, by late July 2020, about 96 % of the targeted children were vaccinated in a mass measles campaign, demonstrating resilience of service delivery under challenging conditions.

Data from immunization coverage analyses suggest that full immunization coverage in Ethiopia remained relatively stable during the pandemic period, with only minor declines observed in months such as March and November 2020, when compared to pre-pandemic levels, indicating that routine services showed resilience despite COVID-19 challenges.

Overall, between December 2019 and November 2020, Ethiopia worked to sustain essential vaccination programs in the face of pandemic pressures, balancing the need to protect children from vaccine-preventable diseases against the risks posed by COVID-19, and adapting delivery strategies to ensure continuity of services wherever possible.</p>

      <h2>Chemical Hazard Risk Mapping – Kroma Chemical Industry and Çayırova District (Turkey)</h2>
      <p>Chemical Hazard Risk Mapping – Kroma Chemical Industry and Çayırova District (Turkey)

In industrial districts such as Çayırova in Kocaeli Province, Turkey, chemical hazard risk mapping analyses are designed to systematically assess how chemical facilities like the Kroma chemical industry could pose health and environmental risks to workers and surrounding communities. Industrial zones in this region typically host a range of chemical production and processing facilities, and risk assessments are used to identify hazardous substances, evaluate potential exposure pathways, and estimate levels of risk to human health and the environment. These processes usually combine spatial data with monitoring results for air, soil and water quality to produce risk maps that show where contamination may be higher and where sensitive receptors — such as residential areas, schools, or hospitals — are located relative to emission sources.

A chemical hazard risk mapping analysis generally includes several core components:
1. Hazard Identification: Facilities like Kroma are evaluated to determine which chemicals are present, their properties (e.g., toxicity, volatility), and how they are used or stored. Chemicals such as solvents, intermediates, and potentially hazardous by‑products are catalogued based on safety data sheets and industrial inventories.
2. Exposure Assessment: Mapping looks at how chemicals might migrate from industrial sites — through air emissions, discharge to water, or soil contamination — and how people or ecosystems could be exposed. For example, wind patterns, proximity to residential zones and land use patterns are considered when estimating potential inhalation or ingestion exposure.
3. Risk Characterization: Using modeled or measured concentrations of chemicals in environmental media, risk mapping combines exposure estimates with toxicological reference values to assess hazard quotients or indices for different population groups (workers, children, adults). Industrialized and urban soil studies in Turkey often find potentially toxic elements (PTEs) and other contaminants at varying levels, and risk assessments look at their spatial distribution to identify hotspots where risks might be elevated.
4. Spatial Representation: Results are translated into maps showing where environmental concentrations of chemicals or risk indicators exceed benchmarks, facilitating targeted mitigation and emergency planning.

In the broader Çayırova region, ambient monitoring (e.g., for air quality) is conducted that may show variations in pollution levels influenced by industrial activity, traffic, and meteorological conditions. Although publicly accessible real‑time air quality data do not by themselves provide a full hazard map, they can contribute to an integrated spatial analysis by indicating patterns of pollutants that could be linked to chemical industry emissions.

Outcomes of such analyses typically inform local authorities, industry and health agencies about where enhanced monitoring, emission controls, community health surveillance, or land use planning measures are needed. They also help prioritize areas for remediation or regulatory action to reduce exposure and protect public health.</p>

      <h2>Health, Nutrition and Humanitarian Needs Assessment in Ethiopia (2017–2018)</h2>
      <p>In January 2017, the Government of Ethiopia and humanitarian partners launched the 2017 Humanitarian Requirements Document, which sought US $948 million to assist about 5.6 million people in urgent need of emergency food and non-food assistance due to a new drought caused by failed rains, particularly in southern and eastern areas of the country. The plan prioritized sectors including water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH), food, nutrition, health, and protection.

2. OCHA Situation Reports from Early 2017
OCHA’s Humanitarian Response Situation Reports (e.g., No. 10 and No. 11) from March and April 2017 highlighted that the humanitarian situation was rapidly evolving as deepening drought, harvest losses and disease outbreaks (including acute watery diarrhoea, or AWD) increased the number of people in need beyond initial estimates. These reports discussed the integrated multi-sector response involving health and nutrition services and noted ongoing funding gaps.

3. Mid-Year Humanitarian Updates (July 2017)
Weekly bulletins from July 2017 provided updates on the humanitarian context, including drought impacts and associated needs for services such as safe water, food assistance and health outreach. These bulletins typically included health risks and emergency responses in affected regions.

4. OCHA Annual Report 2017 Highlights
The OCHA Annual Report 2017 provides a broader overview showing that the humanitarian situation worsened over the course of the year, with the estimated number of people in need rising from 5.6 million to about 8.5 million by late 2017 due to persistent drought and other stressors. Somalia, Oromia and other lowland regions remained areas of concentrated need, and funding from mechanisms such as the Ethiopia Humanitarian Fund and CERF supported interventions across food, nutrition and health sectors.

5. UNICEF SitRep & Sector Data (2017)
Although not strictly OCHA, UNICEF’s Humanitarian Situation Reports from early 2017 align with OCHA’s findings, indicating that 5.6 million people required food assistance, and there were significant needs for safe water, health, nutrition and protection services. These sitreps also described efforts to deliver measles vaccination campaigns to tens of millions of children as part of emergency health responses.</p>

      <h2>Chart 5</h2>
      <p>During 2017–2018, Ethiopia faced significant humanitarian challenges driven by recurrent drought, localized flooding, disease outbreaks, and escalating internal displacement. According to humanitarian assessments coordinated by the Government of Ethiopia and OCHA, the number of people requiring emergency assistance increased substantially over this period. In early 2017, approximately 5.6 million people were identified as needing urgent humanitarian support due to failed seasonal rains affecting pastoral and agricultural livelihoods, particularly in Somali, Oromia, Afar, and SNNP regions. As the year progressed and drought conditions persisted, the estimated number of people in need rose to about 8.5 million by late 2017, reflecting deteriorating food security, water shortages, and public health risks.

Health sector assessments highlighted that drought conditions severely strained basic health services. Water scarcity and poor sanitation contributed to outbreaks of communicable diseases, including acute watery diarrhoea (AWD), measles, and scabies in several regions. Health facilities in affected areas often operated at reduced capacity due to supply shortages, limited staffing, and increased caseloads. Mobile health and nutrition teams were deployed to reach remote and pastoralist communities, but access constraints and funding gaps limited coverage.

Nutrition assessments during 2017–2018 showed persistently high levels of acute malnutrition among children under five and pregnant and lactating women. Hundreds of thousands of children required treatment for severe acute malnutrition (SAM), while millions more were vulnerable to moderate acute malnutrition (MAM). Repeated shocks, including drought and displacement caused by inter-communal conflict, undermined household food consumption and coping capacity. By 2018, conflict-related displacement further intensified humanitarian needs, increasing the number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) and stretching already limited health and nutrition services.

Humanitarian response plans in both years emphasized multi-sector coordination, integrating food assistance, therapeutic feeding programs, vaccination campaigns, disease surveillance, water and sanitation interventions, and emergency health services. International partners, including UN agencies (UNICEF, WHO, WFP), NGOs, and donors, supported the national response through large-scale appeals and coordinated cluster mechanisms. Despite substantial efforts, funding shortfalls and the scale of needs meant that vulnerabilities remained high, particularly in drought-affected lowland areas and displacement-affected regions.

Overall, the 2017–2018 humanitarian needs assessment period in Ethiopia demonstrated the interconnected nature of climate shocks, health risks, malnutrition, and displacement, underscoring the importance of resilience-building, strengthened health systems, and sustained multi-sector humanitarian coordination.</p>

      <h2>COVID-19 Epidemiology in the United States (2019–2024)</h2>
      <p>COVID-19 Epidemiology in the United States (2019–2024)

The first confirmed COVID-19 case in the United States was reported in January 2020 in Washington State, linked to travel from China; community transmission was soon detected soon after the virus reached the U.S. in late 2019/early 2020. From that point, the pandemic unfolded as a series of waves of infections geographically distributed across all 50 states and U.S. territories, with urban and high-population-density areas often showing early and intense outbreaks due to higher contact rates and travel connections. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) maintained detailed case counts and mapping through tools such as the COVID Data Tracker, which showed daily and cumulative case counts and state-level trends throughout the pandemic.

COVID-19 cases surged in multiple waves, beginning with the initial outbreak in early 2020 followed by significant peaks in late 2020/early 2021, driven by the ancestral virus, and later in 2021–2022 with more transmissible variants, including Delta and Omicron sublineages. Widespread geographic spread was marked by seasonal and behavioral patterns: peaks often occurred in colder months (November–April) and were also observed during summer periods associated with increased travel and gatherings, reflecting a seasonal tendency in transmission dynamics similar to other respiratory pathogens.

Over time, case counts in the U.S. reached tens of millions, with hospitalizations and deaths concentrated among older adults and individuals with underlying conditions. Data from 2023–2024 indicate that adults aged ≥65 years continued to account for a large proportion of COVID-19–associated hospitalizations, especially among those not up to date on recommended vaccines.

Vaccination became a central intervention beginning in December 2020, when the U.S. COVID-19 Vaccination Program was launched. By mid-2022, hundreds of millions of vaccine doses had been administered, with a large portion of the population receiving at least one dose and many completing their primary series; booster campaigns followed to maintain protection against evolving variants. Vaccination was shown to reduce transmission, severity, hospitalizations and deaths, especially when boosters were up to date, although uptake varied by region, age group and vaccine confidence.

Public health interventions evolved as understanding of the virus improved. Early measures included travel restrictions, lockdowns, mask mandates, expanded testing and contact tracing. Later strategies focused on vaccination campaigns, targeted booster recommendations for high-risk groups, and guidance on ventilation and masking in high-transmission settings. Health education efforts emphasized the importance of vaccination, preventive behaviors (e.g., masking, staying home when ill), and the role of ventilation and personal hygiene in reducing spread. These communication efforts were delivered through CDC campaigns, state health departments and partnerships with healthcare providers to build trust and counter misinformation.

Trends over time show that disease severity declined as vaccination coverage increased and population immunity strengthened from both vaccines and prior infection. Hospitalizations and deaths declined from the peaks of 2020–2021, although COVID-19 continued to cause significant morbidity and mortality into 2024, especially among older adults who had not received recent vaccine doses. Moreover, surveillance data indicate that COVID-19 activity persisted with recurring seasonal patterns, suggesting that periodic surges continue to occur each year.

Overall, the U.S. experience from 2019 to 2024 reflects the evolution of a global pandemic into a more managed endemic phase, with vaccination, public health interventions and adaptive health communication playing key roles in reducing severe outcomes and guiding response strategies in a changing epidemiological landscape.</p>

      <h2>Health Facility Damage in Syria During the Civil War (2011–2025)</h2>
      <p>The Syrian civil war profoundly devastated the country’s health system, with health facilities repeatedly damaged, destroyed, or rendered non‑functional due to hostilities, aerial bombardments, shelling and insecurity:

Before 2011, Syria’s health infrastructure was already below the regional average; during the war, major attacks on healthcare quickly escalated, with Physicians for Human Rights documenting attacks on hundreds of facilities and deaths or forced flight of health personnel. By mid‑2016, 14 hospitals and 57 medical centres in Aleppo alone had been destroyed or damaged, and across key conflict areas a high proportion of all medical centres, specialized centres and polyclinics had some form of physical damage.

Over the course of the conflict, ongoing attacks repeatedly hit hospitals, clinics, health centres and medical supply routes, with many facilities closing or operating only partially due to insecurity and destruction. Monitoring by humanitarian and health partners showed that thousands of health infrastructure attacks had occurred since 2011, with structures repeatedly repaired only to be hit again during major offensives.

Assessments show that by the early 2020s a significant proportion of health facilities was only partially functional or non‑functional. Before the February 2023 earthquakes — on top of war damage — only around 59 % of hospitals and about 57 % of primary health care facilities were fully functional, meaning that 41 %+ of hospitals and 43 %+ of PHCs were partially or completely out of service.

The 2023 earthquake added to the destruction, with one WHO/HeRAMS assessment reporting that 146 health facilities were damaged by the quake and its aftershocks, including multiple hospitals and primary health centres in Aleppo, Hama, Latakia and other governorates.

By 2025, continuing instability and lack of funding left hundreds of facilities at risk of closure or already non‑operational; for example, reports noted that across northwest Syria alone over 170 health facilities were at risk of imminent closure due to lack of funds, and many that remain open operate at reduced capacity.

As of late 2024–2025, humanitarian assessments indicate that millions of people remain without reliable access to essential health services, in part because damage and degradation of health infrastructure have persisted for more than a decade.

In summary, countless hospitals, clinics and primary health centres were damaged or destroyed during the conflict — with many facilities never fully restored — and significant proportions of the health system were partially functional or out of service at various points through the war. This destruction, compounded by earthquakes and chronic under‑funding, severely constrained healthcare access for millions of Syrians.</p>

      <h2>Chart 28</h2>
      <p>From early 2020 (when the first U.S. cases were identified) through 2025, COVID‑19 spread widely across the United States with multiple waves driven by evolving variants such as Alpha, Delta and Omicron. Urban and high‑population‑density areas tended to show earlier and larger outbreaks because of greater person‑to‑person contact, while rural regions had delayed peaks but also substantial impacts over time. Case counts nationally totaled tens of millions of reported infections, with many more undetected infections estimated by seroprevalence and modeling studies. Severe outcomes clustered heavily by age — older adults (especially those ≥65 and ≥75 years) consistently had higher hospitalization and death rates than younger groups, with about half of hospitalizations in recent surveillance among those ≥75 years of age, and lower but non‑trivial risk among adults 50–64 and 18–49 years. Children and adolescents made up a much smaller proportion of hospitalizations overall, though infants and the very young had relatively higher rates within pediatric groups. Males generally experienced somewhat higher hospitalization and severity rates than females in early pandemic data, though both sexes were widely affected across age groups.

Transmission occurred primarily through respiratory droplets and aerosols from infected people, with higher spread in indoor, crowded settings — especially before widespread vaccination and masking. Interventions evolved over time: early responses included lockdowns, school and business closures, widespread testing, contact tracing and mask mandates; later efforts focused more on vaccination campaigns, targeted boosters for high‑risk populations, and guidance to improve ventilation and reduce indoor crowding. Health education campaigns by the CDC and public health partners encouraged vaccination, masking in high‑transmission settings and staying home when sick; over time, compliance varied by community and political context, influencing local outbreak sizes.

Vaccination began in December 2020 with mRNA and viral vector vaccines; by mid‑2022 many millions in the U.S. had received at least one dose, with booster coverage lagging among booster‑eligible populations. Counties with higher vaccine uptake (≥80% fully vaccinated) had significantly lower rates of COVID‑19 cases and deaths than counties with lower coverage, demonstrating the protective effect of vaccines at the community level. Uptake also showed demographic variation by age, race and urban/rural setting, with older adults more likely to be vaccinated than younger adults. Uptake of updated seasonal vaccines continued through 2024–2025, though overall coverage remained uneven and often lower than early enthusiasm in 2021.

Geographically, major metropolitan regions saw early high case counts that shifted over time to include broad rural spread as public health measures and behaviors changed; wastewater monitoring became a useful complementary tool for tracking community transmission. A 2025 update noted rising COVID‑19 activity in many states, particularly in the western U.S., reflecting continued virus circulation and emergence of new variant lineages, even as severe outcomes (hospitalizations and deaths) have generally declined relative to early pandemic peaks thanks to immunity from vaccination and prior infection.

Trends from 2019–2025 saw a progression from the initial pandemic emergency through phases of high impact (2020–2021), vaccination‑driven reductions in severe disease (2022 onward), and ongoing seasonal or variant‑linked waves. Hospitalization and death rates have been highest in older age groups and among those not up‑to‑date with vaccines; public health strategies continue to focus on booster campaigns for high‑risk populations and maintaining capacity for surveillance, treatment and prevention in the face of evolving viral patterns.</p>

      <h2>Chemical Hazard Risk Mapping in Çayırova: Assessing Industrial Pollution and Public Health Risks</h2>
      <p>Chemical Hazard Risk Mapping – Kroma Chemical Industry and Çayırova District (Turkey)

In industrial districts such as Çayırova in Kocaeli Province, Turkey, chemical hazard risk mapping analyses are designed to systematically assess how chemical facilities like the Kroma chemical industry could pose health and environmental risks to workers and surrounding communities. Industrial zones in this region typically host a range of chemical production and processing facilities, and risk assessments are used to identify hazardous substances, evaluate potential exposure pathways, and estimate levels of risk to human health and the environment. These processes usually combine spatial data with monitoring results for air, soil and water quality to produce risk maps that show where contamination may be higher and where sensitive receptors — such as residential areas, schools, or hospitals — are located relative to emission sources.

A chemical hazard risk mapping analysis generally includes several core components:
1. Hazard Identification: Facilities like Kroma are evaluated to determine which chemicals are present, their properties (e.g., toxicity, volatility), and how they are used or stored. Chemicals such as solvents, intermediates, and potentially hazardous by‑products are catalogued based on safety data sheets and industrial inventories.
2. Exposure Assessment: Mapping looks at how chemicals might migrate from industrial sites — through air emissions, discharge to water, or soil contamination — and how people or ecosystems could be exposed. For example, wind patterns, proximity to residential zones and land use patterns are considered when estimating potential inhalation or ingestion exposure.
3. Risk Characterization: Using modeled or measured concentrations of chemicals in environmental media, risk mapping combines exposure estimates with toxicological reference values to assess hazard quotients or indices for different population groups (workers, children, adults). Industrialized and urban soil studies in Turkey often find potentially toxic elements (PTEs) and other contaminants at varying levels, and risk assessments look at their spatial distribution to identify hotspots where risks might be elevated.
4. Spatial Representation: Results are translated into maps showing where environmental concentrations of chemicals or risk indicators exceed benchmarks, facilitating targeted mitigation and emergency planning.

In the broader Çayırova region, ambient monitoring (e.g., for air quality) is conducted that may show variations in pollution levels influenced by industrial activity, traffic, and meteorological conditions. Although publicly accessible real‑time air quality data do not by themselves provide a full hazard map, they can contribute to an integrated spatial analysis by indicating patterns of pollutants that could be linked to chemical industry emissions.

Outcomes of such analyses typically inform local authorities, industry and health agencies about where enhanced monitoring, emission controls, community health surveillance, or land use planning measures are needed. They also help prioritize areas for remediation or regulatory action to reduce exposure and protect public health.</p>

      <h2>Epidemiology of Scabies During Drought and Displacement in Ethiopia (2016–2018)</h2>
      <p>From 2016 through 2018, Ethiopia experienced a major humanitarian emergency shaped by the worst drought in decades triggered by the El Niño climate event, repeated failed rains, and later by floods and escalating local conflicts, all of which seriously undermined food security, health and nutrition outcomes. OCHA reports from 2016 show that drought conditions significantly eroded people’s ability to cope, increasing the numbers of people needing emergency assistance and contributing to widespread food insecurity and high malnutrition rates, particularly among children and pregnant women, while continued humanitarian monitoring highlighted persisting needs into 2018 as recovery remained elusive and institutional capacity was strained.

The crisis went beyond food insecurity; health services were heavily impacted by drought‑related water shortages and inadequate sanitation, which in turn contributed to overlapping disease outbreaks. Early OCHA and partner reporting from 2016 documented that outbreaks of scabies occurred in several regions, including Amhara and Tigray, affecting tens of thousands of people, alongside other communicable diseases like measles and acute watery diarrhoea, illustrating how poor WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene) conditions and displacement heightened public health risks. A detailed investigation in 2016 recorded thousands of suspected scabies cases in drought‑affected districts such as East Badewacho in the Southern region, with children and larger households especially at risk.

Humanitarian health systems were also stretched because routine services were disrupted and many health facilities were either non‑functional or operating at reduced capacity, making it harder to deliver basic care, nutrition treatment and outbreak response at scale. Across 2017–2018, OCHA situation reports documented hundreds of thousands of scabies cases reported nationally, and because the drought, food insecurity, and displacement persisted, malnutrition remained a leading cause of morbidity, requiring large‑scale emergency nutrition treatment alongside disease control measures.

International assistance coordinated through OCHA, in partnership with the Ethiopian government and humanitarian actors such as UNICEF, WHO and WFP, sought to address these needs through multi‑sector appeals and response plans that combined food aid, nutrition support, mobile health and nutrition teams, disease surveillance and outbreak interventions. Despite sustained efforts, funding gaps, logistical delays and ongoing climatic and security challenges meant that needs often outpaced the response.</p>

      <h2>Ethiopia’s 2016–2018 Humanitarian Crisis: Drought, Malnutrition, and Humanitarian Response</h2>
      <p>From 2016 through 2018, Ethiopia faced a major humanitarian emergency driven primarily by severe drought — especially during the strong El Niño event — which sharply reduced rainfall, crop yields and livestock survival across large parts of the country, leaving more than 10 million people in need of emergency food assistance and pushing levels of moderate to acute malnutrition higher than typical for the region. National monitoring showed that as many as 2.5 million people experienced moderate to acute malnutrition, including many children and pregnant or breastfeeding women, and hundreds of thousands of children required treatment for severe acute malnutrition as health and nutrition services struggled to keep up with the rising caseloads. Conflict in parts of Ethiopia’s south and south‑east — including ethnic clashes in Oromia and SNNP regions — generated displacement and further food insecurity, contributing to humanitarian needs beyond drought alone. In 2018, humanitarian appeals by the Ethiopian government and partners sought more than US $1.4 billion to respond to drought, floods, conflict and other crisis effects, and UNICEF and other agencies delivered mobile health and nutrition teams, vaccinations and life‑saving interventions to millions of children and mothers despite ongoing access challenges. Throughout this period, international actors including the United Nations (e.g., World Food Programme, UNICEF, WHO) and NGOs played critical roles in providing emergency food, nutrition treatment and basic health services, while planning efforts — such as the Humanitarian and Disaster Resilience Plan launched in 2018 — aimed to coordinate relief for nearly 8 million people in need of food assistance and millions more needing non‑food support..</p>
